# Chat-bot

Project during web. developer bootcamp. The project was to building a functional chatbot interface using JavaScript.


## The problem

Problems were solved by having sessions with my team, Stack, class material and chatGPT. Had particulary one problem with the bot repeating one of the questions. Eventually this was solved by adding a global variable. Lots of time was put in to solve the issue which took time from developing the bot further. Next step would be to add more questions, try out a dropdown list, improve the design and play around with sound effects.
